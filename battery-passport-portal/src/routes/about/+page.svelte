			Arxum is actively engaged in the collaborative research project named ZIRKEL focusing on to
			sustainably increase the productivity and economic efficiency in the dismantling, separating
			and dividing process of traction battery systems in order to identify the ecologically and
			economically optimal recycling route for specific products and, as a result, to completely
			close the material cycles.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a part of this innovative research project, ARXUM is implementing an ultimate
			blockchain-based solution for the digital product passports (DPPs), adhering to new EU battery
			passport regulations, driving innovation and change in industries.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this DPP solution, we will capture, store and display battery passport data, ensuring
			security, confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Moreover, we will store and manage the
			carbon footprint associated with each battery. This data can be leveraged for environmental
			reporting, carbon offset strategies, and eco-conscious decision-making. A small step towards
			greener future!

				The Battery Regulation has been officially adopted in the Official Journal of the European
				Union on July 12, 2023! This marks the final step of formally adopting the regulation that
				aims for a more sustainable, circular and responsible battery ecosystem.
			</li>
			<li>
				On 18 August 2023 (21 days after the publication in the journal), the regulation will enter
				into force, setting new standards for the production, use, and end of life management of
				batteries within the European Union.
			</li>
			<li>
				From 18 February 2027, each LMT battery, industrial battery with a capacity greater than 2
				kWh and electric vehicle battery placed on the EU market will have to provide battery
				lifecycle information via a battery passport.
